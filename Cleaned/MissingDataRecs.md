Looking at the number of data points for each lap compared to the time in msecs (which should match) I could see that there are often records 
missing from the Public.csv files that are not missing from the Global.txt files. Usually this occurs in the first and last laps but sometimes at other 
random points.

### Observations (excluding first and last lap):  
- Test Run 3 - Lap 14 has 6 recs missing
- Test Run 4 - Lap 2 has 27 recs missing
- Test Run 5 - ok
- Test Run 6 â€“ 4 laps missing records (see table opposite)
- Test Run 7 - ok
- Test Run 8 - Lap 12 has 30 recs missing
- Test Run 9 - Lap 15 has 30 recs missing
- Test Run 10 - ok
